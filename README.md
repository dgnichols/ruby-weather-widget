Ruby Weather Widget

To run the script, either download "rww.rb" or clone the repository to a local directory.


If you do not have Git or a compatible version control tool available, please consider using the new GitHub client as follows:

1. Navigate to https://desktop.github.com/ and follow instructions relevant to your selected environment.

2. After intial configuration of the client, select "Clone a repository from the internet..."

3. In the "Clone a repository" dialogue, select "URL", and enter: https://github.com/dgnichols/ruby-weather-widget.git


The script requires a Ruby interpreter and a handful of gems. The following steps may be necessary if you do not already have these resources installed:

1. Navigate to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and follow instructions relevant to your selected environment.

2. Run the following command to install gems we will use during the execution of the script: gem install artii tzinfo tzinfo-data

Finally, with the script, interpreter, and dependencies installed, simply execute the script at the command line to retrieve and display the current weather info.
